<h1>Normal People</h1>
<h2>By Sally Rooney</h2>
<h3>An additional favorite by her: Conversations with Friends</h3>

<p>Never have I read a book and felt such a deep connection to the minds of the characters as I do whenever I read a book by Sally Rooney. Normal People is just a beautiful story that never really ends. Sally Rooney's books feel like real life.</p>
