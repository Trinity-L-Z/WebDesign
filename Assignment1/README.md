# _Chocolat_

## By Joanne Harris

Genuinely I have such a hard time picking a favorite anything, but I love this book! It is magical and wonderfully empowering. Centered around female characters, it takes place in a charming little village colored grey by an overbearing pastor. The main character is suggestively a witch, and her ending is merely suggested rather than defined for the reader (something I really enjoy). Slowly, color and happiness and freedom enter the hearts and lives of all the characters. If this book had queer representation in it, it would easily be my favorite book of all time; however, I do like to imagine that there are queer subtexts between two characters...
