I had some difficulty getting the styling to work within the list. Definitely took some trial and error to understand that I need styling to be embedded within the different elements (from nav, ul, li, a).

I am feeling proud of how my coding is actually working, regardless of how many attempts it took to make it happen.

Recently, my partner broke up with me and it has been devastating. This is why my assignment is late, because I had a hard time focusing on classwork last week. I apologize. But I am looking forward to recentering!
