What would you add or refine in the future?
In the future, I would like to figure out why the first image in my photography gallery pages did not align the same way as the rest. Refining this would help my site feel complete. Additionally, it would be cool to add more in-depth information for the painting portfolio (such as, a button that takes you to another page explaining the details)

How do you see yourself using these skills in the future?
I currently host a webstie through Squarespace. It is really cool having a better udnerstanding of how the site works, as well as how I can personally customize it. This site is also expensive to maintain, and it would be cool to explore more affordable alternatives.

How did you balance creativity with usability?
My biggest problem as a creative is getting too crazy with colors--I often find myself with five different colors in a design, which are ultimately distracting and take away from the overall feeling. For this site, I maintained a limited color pallette and ensured that the text was easy to read over the background.

I really enjoyed making my own personal portfolio. At first, I felt overwhelmed by how much content I wanted to add and how small my grasp on HTML is. In the end, utilizing CSS and Bootstrap was fast and made the project feel cohesive.
